# SciFiLighting
Code for Sci fi Backlight.
Main file is SciFiLighting.ino, name your f–ælder like that after cloning the repoitory(if it is not named properly).
# How to upload code into arduino UNO R3:
 - Download all files
 - Rename folder to SciFiLighting if needed
 - Open main file
 - Select your arduino type and corresponding port
 - Upload
# How to build a prototype
 - Download [3D models](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4830996)
 - Print them with 3D-printer
 - Sold elecronics(IR sensor with resistors and LEDs strip)
 - For pins and settings see main .ino file.

# RF protocol(control via RF)
First of all, message is looking something like {"code": 1234}.
The field "code" contains decimal number representing a code of operation.
This program uses ArduinoJson, so too big messages are restricted(40 characters for now).

**Memory usage is too high, some modes are temporarily disabled.**
